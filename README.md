# SERENITY-DAY-SPA-CUSTOMER-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD
**TIME PERIOD** – ```April 2021``` <br/>
<br/>
**Audience** - ```Serenity Day Spa ``` <br/>
<br/>
**Goal** - ```To gain customer insights for marketing.```.<br/>
<br/>
**Context** – The Serenity Day Spa management was preparing a new marketing campaign and wanted some insight into the best segmentation strategy. Historical data usually provides an accurate base for forecasting so with their current database I designed a customer analysis dashboard to enable them to view their revenue generation by different segments. Each chart on the dashboard was linked so could be used as a filter for the other charts. This enabled the client to be view how each customer attribute related to another and draw conclusions. <br/>
